# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Collaborative Code Review Simulator with AI Feedback is an innovative platform that enhances the code review process by combining real-time collaboration with AI-driven insights. The system provides developers with a simulated peer review environment where they can upload code snippets, receive AI-generated suggestions, and engage in collaborative discussions with both human reviewers and AI-simulated debates.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to upload code snippets for review, so that I can receive feedback and improve my code quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads a code snippet THEN the system SHALL accept common programming languages (JavaScript, Python, Java, C++, etc.)
2. WHEN a code snippet is uploaded THEN the system SHALL validate the file format and size limits
3. WHEN a code snippet is successfully uploaded THEN the system SHALL create a unique review session
4. IF the uploaded file exceeds size limits THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to collaborate with other developers in real-time during code reviews, so that we can discuss and improve code together.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple users join a review session THEN the system SHALL synchronize their views in real-time
2. WHEN a user adds an annotation or comment THEN all other users SHALL see the update immediately
3. WHEN a user highlights code sections THEN other users SHALL see the highlighted areas in real-time
4. WHEN users are typing comments THEN the system SHALL show typing indicators to other participants

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to receive AI-generated suggestions for my code, so that I can identify potential bugs, optimizations, and style improvements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a code snippet is uploaded THEN the AI SHALL analyze it for potential bugs
2. WHEN the AI completes analysis THEN the system SHALL display suggestions for code optimizations
3. WHEN the AI identifies style issues THEN the system SHALL provide specific improvement recommendations
4. WHEN AI suggestions are generated THEN they SHALL be categorized by type (bug, optimization, style)
5. IF the AI analysis fails THEN the system SHALL provide a fallback message and continue with manual review

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to engage in AI-simulated debates about code changes, so that I can explore different perspectives and make more informed decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN debate mode is activated THEN the AI SHALL generate arguments for proposed code changes
2. WHEN debate mode is active THEN the AI SHALL also generate counter-arguments against proposed changes
3. WHEN AI generates debate points THEN they SHALL be based on realistic software development scenarios
4. WHEN users respond to AI debate points THEN the AI SHALL continue the discussion contextually
5. IF no debate points can be generated THEN the system SHALL gracefully fall back to standard review mode

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to manage my review sessions securely, so that my code and discussions remain private and organized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates an account THEN the system SHALL require secure authentication
2. WHEN a user starts a review session THEN the system SHALL generate a unique session identifier
3. WHEN a user invites others to a session THEN the system SHALL control access through session permissions
4. WHEN a review session ends THEN the system SHALL save the session history for the user
5. IF unauthorized access is attempted THEN the system SHALL deny access and log the attempt

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the platform to handle multiple concurrent review sessions, so that teams can work on different code reviews simultaneously.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple review sessions are active THEN the system SHALL maintain separate real-time connections for each
2. WHEN users switch between sessions THEN the system SHALL preserve the state of each session
3. WHEN the system reaches capacity limits THEN it SHALL queue new sessions or display appropriate messaging
4. WHEN a session becomes inactive THEN the system SHALL automatically clean up resources after a timeout period

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see the history and outcomes of code reviews, so that I can track improvements and learn from past discussions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a review session concludes THEN the system SHALL save all comments, suggestions, and decisions
2. WHEN a user requests session history THEN the system SHALL display past reviews with timestamps
3. WHEN viewing historical reviews THEN users SHALL be able to see the final code state and applied changes
4. WHEN exporting review data THEN the system SHALL provide downloadable reports in common formats

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the AI to provide contextually relevant suggestions, so that the feedback is meaningful and actionable for my specific code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AI analyzes code THEN it SHALL consider the programming language context
2. WHEN generating suggestions THEN the AI SHALL reference specific lines and code sections
3. WHEN providing recommendations THEN the AI SHALL include explanations for why changes are suggested
4. WHEN multiple issues exist THEN the AI SHALL prioritize suggestions by severity and impact
5. IF the code follows best practices THEN the AI SHALL acknowledge good practices in addition to suggesting improvements
